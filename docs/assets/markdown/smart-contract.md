# Overview

The fundamental building block of Ethereum applications is a smart contract, `a computer program stored on a blockchain`.

The term <a href="https://www.fon.hum.uva.nl/rob/Courses/InformationInSpeech/CDROM/Literature/LOTwinterschool2006/szabo.best.vwh.net/smart.contracts.html" target="_blank">Smart Contract</a> was coined in 1994 by `Nick Szabo`. He envisioned a <a href="https://www.fon.hum.uva.nl/rob/Courses/InformationInSpeech/CDROM/Literature/LOTwinterschool2006/szabo.best.vwh.net/smart_contracts_2.html"  target="_blank">digital marketplace</a> in which transactions and business functions can be carried out without the need for `intermediaries`. Ethereum's smart contracts make this vision a reality.

In order to fully understand `smart contracts`, we first need to understand what `traditional contracts` are.


## What is Contract (Traditional contract)?

The concept of a contract is similar to an agreement between two parties to carry out a certain task under certain conditions. The agreement can take any form, be it verbal or written, as long as some conditions are included.

Here is an example:

- `Bob's` house is for sale, and `Alice` wants to buy it.
- In order to transfer ownership of the house, `a third party (intermediary)` is needed to establish the trust. 
- To seal the deal, `Alice` must make some advance payment to `Bob` in front of `a third party` after agreeing to the price as a buyer. `The third party` charges its own fees.
- `Alice` will sign an agreement with `the seller (Bob)`. The terms and conditions of an agreement clarify the parties rights and obligations.
- Once the payment has been made and the agreement has been followed. In the presence of `a third party`, `Bob` will transfer original property documents, title, rights, and ownership to `Alice` (all legal procedures and the law are followed).

Flaws of a Traditional contract:

- **Trusting Intermediaries:** The `third party` may run away at any time. Both parties should rely entirely on the intermediary's reputation. As a result, traditional contracts require trusted intermediaries to fulfill the agreement objective.

- **Cost:** A traditional contract is expensive because a third party company needs to be paid a lot of fees.

- **Speed:** It is time consuming to process because a lawyer and banker need to be involved.

## Smart Contracts:

A `smart contract` is a digital agreement stored on a blockchain that executes automatically when certain terms and conditions are met. All the terms and conditions are written of an agreement into programming code.

Example:

- `Bob` wants to sell his house. 

- In a smart contract, `Bob` specifies the terms and conditions under which he will sell the house and signs it using his private key.

- `Alice` is interested in buying a house.

- `Alice` uses her private key to sign Bob's contract on an internet platform. Finally, `Alice` pays `Bob's` contract the amount of the house price. (Once Alice pays Bob, the smart contract will be executed on the blockchain.) 

- The blockchain network will verify some aspects of the smart contract after it has been executed, such as 
    1. The house belongs to `Bob`, or is he the real owner?
    2. Does `Alice` have enough money to purchase the house? There are also many other conditions.

- All smart contract conditions are met if all nodes in the blockchain network agree. In conclusion, once the smart contract receives the transaction information on the blockchain, the smart contract can automatically change ownership of the asset once `the buyer (Alice)` pays `the seller (Bob)`. There is no longer a need to wait for a `lawyer` and `banker` to process the agreement.

- Without smart contracts, `Alice` and `Bob` would have to pay third-party companies such as a house broker, the bank, a lawyer.

## Imagine a smart contract as a vending machine:

In the case of `vending machines`, you will find similar scenarios as follows:

- Select a product from the menu. The `vending machines` will return the amount you paid once you have selected the product

- Enter the correct amount of the product.

- When you insert the correct amount, the `vending machine` verifies it

- The `vending machine` dispenses the product if the amount is correct.

Your desired product will only be dispensed after all requirements are met such as `vending machines won't give out products if you don't select a product or insert enough money`. In the same way, a `smart contract` works, which guarantees specific outputs in return for specific inputs (once certain terms and conditions are met).

# Applications of smart contracts:

Listed below are some real world examples of smart contracts

- **Auto-pay insurance:** such as <a href="https://etherisc.com/" target="_blank">etherisc</a> 

- **Decentralized arts and collectibles:**  In these applications, you can invest in the work of your favorite creators, increase their earning potential, and invest in digital ownership. such as Foundation, OpenSea, CryptoPunks

- **Decentralized gaming:** In these games, players create virtual worlds and battle other players with collectibles that have real-world value. such as <a href="" target="_blank">decentraland</a>,<a href="" target="_blank"> Axie Infinity</a>, etc.

- **Decentralized technology:** A decentralized developer tool, a platform for open-source development, and integration of cryptoeconomic systems are some of the applications that fall into this category. such as <a href="https://gitcoin.co/" target="_blank">gitcoin Marketplace</a>
