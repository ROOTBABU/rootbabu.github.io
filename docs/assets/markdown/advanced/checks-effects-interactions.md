The "checks-effects-interactions" (CEI) pattern is a best practice in Solidity programming for writing secure and efficient smart contracts.

The CEI pattern involves dividing a function into three parts:

    Checks: In this phase, the function checks the preconditions to ensure that it can safely execute the requested operation. This includes checking the inputs, the state of the contract, and any other conditions that need to be met before proceeding.

    Effects: In this phase, the function carries out the intended operations or modifies the state of the contract. This includes updating variables, calling other functions, and transferring funds.

    Interactions: In this phase, the function interacts with other contracts or external entities. This includes making external calls, sending Ether, and emitting events.

By following the CEI pattern, a Solidity developer can minimize the risk of reentrancy attacks and ensure that their smart contracts operate efficiently and safely. The pattern ensures that all the necessary checks are performed before any state changes are made, reducing the chances of unexpected behavior or unintended consequences.
