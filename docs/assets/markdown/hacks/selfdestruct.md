#  Forcing Ether into a Contract

Forcing Ether into a contract by an attacker can have severe consequences and is generally considered a malicious action. The consequences depend on the nature of the contract and how it handles incoming Ether. Here are some potential risks and consequences:

# selfdestruct

The selfdestruct function in Solidity removes all bytecode from the contract address and transfers all Ether stored in the contract to a specified address. It's important to note that if the specified address is also a contract, no functions, including the fallback function, will be called during the self-destruction process.

The selfdestruct function is typically used to clean up a contract and release any remaining funds to a designated recipient. It can be used in scenarios such as:

**1. Upgrading Contracts:** When a contract needs to be upgraded to a new version, the selfdestruct function can be used to destroy the old contract and transfer its funds and state to the new contract.

**2. Exit Strategies:** Contracts may include an exit strategy where, under certain conditions, the contract self-destructs and sends the funds back to the contract owner or a predefined beneficiary.

Even if a contract is removed by selfdestruct, it is still part of the history of the blockchain and probably retained by most Ethereum nodes. So using selfdestruct is not the same as deleting data from a hard disk.

Starting from version 0.8.18 and onwards, the usage of selfdestruct in both Solidity and Yul will generate a deprecation warning. This warning is triggered because the underlying behavior of the SELFDESTRUCT opcode is expected to undergo breaking changes as outlined in Ethereum Improvement Proposal (EIP) 6049.

As a result, developers are advised to be aware of the deprecation warning and stay informed about the upcoming breaking changes associated with the selfdestruct functionality.
