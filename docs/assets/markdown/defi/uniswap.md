# Uniswap

`Uniswap` is a decentralized cryptocurrency exchange protocol built on the Ethereum blockchain. It allows users to trade Ethereum-based tokens without the need for an intermediary or centralized exchange.

`Uniswap` uses an automated market maker (AMM) system to facilitate trades. This means that instead of relying on an order book like traditional exchanges, `Uniswap` relies on a liquidity pool where users can deposit their tokens and earn a share of the trading fees in return.

Trades on `Uniswap` are executed based on a mathematical formula that ensures that the price of each token in the pool is always balanced in proportion to the relative value of the tokens in the pool. This system makes it possible for users to trade tokens without the need for a centralized authority to match buyers and sellers.

Uniswap uses a system called Automated Market Maker (AMM) to determine the value of different cryptocurrencies. Instead of relying on traditional order books. AMMs use a mathematical formula to set the price of assets based on the supply and demand of tokens in a liquidity pool.

## Liquidity Pool

Uniswap V2 is a platform where traders can exchange one type of cryptocurrency for another. However, they don't trade directly with other traders. Instead, they trade with a pool of cryptocurrencies called a "Liquidity Pool".

Where do the tokens in the Liquidity Pool come from?

The tokens in the Liquidity Pool are added by users called "Liquidity Providers." These providers add tokens to the pool and receive a fee every time a trader swaps tokens with the Liquidity Pool.

Why do Liquidity Providers add tokens to the Liquidity Pool?

Liquidity Providers add their tokens to the Liquidity Pool to earn fees. When traders swap tokens with the Liquidity Pool, they pay a small percentage of the transaction value as a fee. This fee is distributed to Liquidity Providers in proportion to their contribution to the pool.

How does Uniswap V2 route traders and liquidity providers to the correct Liquidity Pool?

Since there are lots of different token pairs, Uniswap V2 routes traders and liquidity providers to the corresponding Liquidity Pool for their transactions. This ensures that traders can easily exchange one token for another, and Liquidity Providers can earn fees on the tokens they contribute to the pool.

Uniswap V2 has many different Liquidity Pools, each of which is a place to trade a specific pair of cryptocurrencies. To make sure traders and liquidity providers can find the right pool, Uniswap V2 directs them to the corresponding Liquidity Pool for their specific trade.







If you're building a `DeFi` project or any decentralized application, Uniswap can be useful in two ways. 

1. Firstly, it provides a smart contract for buying and selling ERC20 tokens, making it easy for users to trade tokens in a decentralized manner. 
2. Secondly, Uniswap allows users to earn interest on their ERC20 tokens by becoming a liquidity provider.
