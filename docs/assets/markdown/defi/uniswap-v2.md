# Uniswap v2

Although Uniswap V3 introduces a range of new features and improvements over Uniswap V2, it is still important to understand the core concepts of Uniswap V2. This is because many of the fundamental principles and concepts of Uniswap V2 still apply in Uniswap V3, and understanding them can help you better understand how Uniswap V3 works and how to use it effectively.

Uniswap v1 was an experimental version of a decentralized marketplace. Its success encouraged the team to make improvements and create a newer version called Uniswap v2, which was released in May 2020.

Uniswap v2 was an improved and easier-to-use version of Uniswap v1. The main issue with v1 was that users couldn't swap one ERC20 token for another directly which made it more expensive and difficult for them. Uniswap v2 fixed this problem by introducing ERC20-ERC20 token pools which making it cheaper and faster to trade different ERC20 tokens.

## ERC20-ERC20 pools

ERC20-ERC20 pools are liquidity pools on Uniswap v2 that allow users to swap one ERC20 token directly for another ERC20 token. In contrast, Uniswap v1 only allowed users to swap ETH for ERC20 tokens, which made it more difficult and expensive to trade between ERC20 tokens.

With ERC20-ERC20 pools, users can trade between any two ERC20 tokens, including stablecoins like USDT, USDC, and DAI, without having to go through ETH as an intermediary. This makes the trading process faster and cheaper, as users only have to pay a single trading fee instead of multiple fees for each intermediate trade.

## The core concepts of Uniswap V2

**Swaps:**

Swaps are the most basic function of Uniswap V2. They allow users to trade one cryptocurrency for another without intermediaries. Swaps occur between two assets in a liquidity pool which consists of a pair of assets. Each pool has a unique address and is identified by its token symbols. For example, the ETH/DAI pool represents the liquidity pool for Ethereum and DAI. When a user makes a swap they send one asset to the pool and receive another asset in exchange. The price of the asset they receive is determined by the pool's automated market maker algorithm.

**Pools:**

Pools are the backbone of Uniswap V2. They are collections of assets held in smart contracts on the Ethereum blockchain. Each pool is identified by a unique address and is associated with a pair of assets. Pools are created and managed by liquidity providers who supply assets to the pool in exchange for fees. Liquidity providers receive a proportional share of the fees generated by the pool based on their contribution to the pool. The size of the pool determines the price of the assets in the pool, with larger pools resulting in lower prices and smaller pools resulting in higher prices.

**Flash Swaps:**

Flash swaps are a new feature introduced in Uniswap V2 that allow users to borrow tokens without collateral. This feature enables users to execute a trade and repay the borrowed tokens in the same transaction. Flash swaps are possible because of the unique design of Uniswap V2 pools, which allow liquidity providers to withdraw their assets at any time. The flash swap feature can be used for arbitrage, collateral-free loans, and other advanced trading strategies.

**Oracles:**

Oracles are price feed providers that supply Uniswap V2 with up-to-date market data. Uniswap V2 uses oracles to determine the price of assets in liquidity pools. Oracles are responsible for providing accurate and reliable price data, which is critical to the proper functioning of Uniswap V2. They ensure that users get the best possible price for their trades, and they also help to prevent price manipulation and other forms of fraud.

In conclusion, Uniswap V2 is a powerful decentralized exchange that provides users with a simple and efficient way to trade cryptocurrencies. The core concepts of Uniswap V2, including swaps, pools, flash swaps, and oracles, are critical to understanding how the platform works and how to use it effectively. By mastering these concepts, users can take advantage of the full range of features offered by Uniswap V2 and benefit from the growing DeFi ecosystem.

## Limitation

Uniswap V2 was a groundbreaking DEX that was one of the first DeFi applications to gain widespread adoption. However, despite its success, there were several issues with Uniswap V2 that led to the development of Uniswap V3.

One of the main problems with Uniswap V2 was that it suffered from high slippage, particularly when trading larger orders. Slippage is the difference between the expected price of an asset and the actual price paid, and it can be significant in high-volume or illiquid markets. In Uniswap V2, slippage could be particularly high because liquidity was evenly spread across the price range of an asset pair, which meant that large trades could quickly deplete the available liquidity and result in significant price movements.

Another issue with Uniswap V2 was that liquidity providers had limited control over how their assets were used. In Uniswap V2, liquidity providers could only supply assets to a liquidity pool and earn fees based on the volume of trades in the pool. However, they had no control over where in the price range their liquidity was used, which meant that their assets could be used to facilitate trades that were not in their best interests.
