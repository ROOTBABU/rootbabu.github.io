## Traditional finance / Centralized Finance (CeFi) 

`Traditional finance` refers to the established financial system which is dominated by centralized institutions like `banks`, `stock exchanges`, and other intermediaries. These institutions offer a range of services such as `lending`, `borrowing`, `investing`, and `trading` to both individuals and businesses.

However, the overall control of the traditional financial system lies in the hands of people in charge of banks, insurance companies, and other financial institutions. This centralized control can lead to mismanagement, fraud, or corruption, as seen in past financial crises.

The financial system services are critical to any nation economy and are provided by banks, lenders, insurance companies, and other institutions. These services encompass transferring money, lending, saving and investment plans, insurance, stock market, and more.

`Decentralized Finance` or `DeFi` aims to provide these financial services through a decentralized ecosystem, free from centralized control or intermediaries. This new financial system promises more transparency, accessibility, and security for users making it an exciting development for the future of finance.

## DeFi

`DeFi` stands for Decentralized Finance which refers to a new type of financial system that uses blockchain technology to provide financial services without relying on traditional financial institutions such as banks.

`DeFi` applications are built on blockchain networks such as Ethereum, Binance Smart Chain and other similar platforms and they use smart contracts to automate financial transactions. `DeFi` applications can be accessed by anyone with an internet connection and a compatible cryptocurrency wallet without requiring a middleman.

## Problems in Traditional Finance

Understanding the problems that exist in the traditional financial system is an essential step in realizing the potential benefits of `DeFi`.

**1. Limited Access:** `Traditional finance institutions` require certain qualifications, documents, and credit scores to allow individuals to open bank accounts or access financial services. For example, if someone doesn't have a permanent address or identification documents, they may be unable to open a bank account, making it difficult for them to participate in the financial system.

**2. Lack of Access Affecting Employability:** Without access to financial services individuals may not be able to receive salaries electronically and instead they would be paid in cash. This can affect their employability because some companies only offer electronic payment options. For example, a person without a bank account may not be able to apply for jobs that require electronic payment options.

**3. Financial Services Can Block Payments:** `Financial institutions` may block or freeze accounts for various reasons such as suspected fraudulent activity, leaving individuals without access to their funds. For instance, a person who is wrongly suspected of fraudulent activities by their bank may have their account frozen, making it impossible for them to access their money.

**4. Hidden Charges:** `Financial institutions` often charge fees for their services such as ATM fees, account maintenance fees, and transaction fees. Additionally many institutions collect data on their customers spending patterns which can be sold to third parties for profit. For example, a bank may charge a monthly maintenance fee on an account that doesn't meet a minimum balance requirement.

**5. Governments and Centralized Institutions:** `Centralized financial institutions` can be shut down by governments or regulatory authorities. For example, in some countries governments have shut down stock markets and other financial institutions during times of political unrest or economic instability.

**6. Limited Trading Hours:** `Traditional finance markets` operate within specific time zones and trading hours are often limited to business hours. For example, the New York Stock Exchange operates between 9:30 am and 4:00 pm Eastern Time making it difficult for people in other time zones to participate in trading.

**7. Slow Transactions:** Transactions in `traditional finance` can take several days to complete due to internal processes and human intervention. For example, it can take several days for a check to clear and for funds to become available in an account.

**8. Premium for Intermediaries:** `Financial services` have a premium attached to them because intermediary institutions need their cut. For instance, when sending money internationally banks charge a fee and the exchange rate is often unfavorable to the sender.

Overall, `DeFi` aims to address these issues by leveraging decentralized networks, smart contracts, and blockchain technology to create a more accessible, transparent, and cost-effective financial system.

## Traditional Finance vs DeFi

Traditional finance refers to the conventional financial systems that have been in place for decades whereas DeFi (Decentralized Finance) is a new. Blockchain-based financial system that has emerged in recent years. The main differences between traditional finance and DeFi lie in their institutional structures, market makers, and the types of assets they deal with.

### Institutional Structure

In traditional finance, `financial institutions` such as banks, insurance companies, and brokerage firms act as intermediaries between investors and the markets. These institutions are regulated by government bodies and are subject to a wide range of laws and regulations designed to protect investors and ensure the stability of the financial system. These regulations can be both a strength and a weakness, as they provide a level of security for investors, but they can also be restrictive and can limit innovation.

On the other hand, `DeFi` is a decentralized system that does not rely on intermediaries. Instead, it is based on blockchain technology which allows users to interact with each other directly and to carry out transactions without the need for a central authority. This makes `DeFi` more open and accessible but it also means that there is no centralized authority to ensure the stability of the system.

### Market Makers

In traditional finance, `market makers` are usually large financial institutions that provide liquidity to the markets. They do this by buying and selling securities and other financial instruments and by setting bid and ask prices that reflect supply and demand. Market makers are an essential part of the financial system as they ensure that there is always a buyer and a seller for any given security.

In DeFi, `market makers` are decentralized networks of users who provide liquidity to the system by lending or borrowing cryptocurrencies. These users are incentivized to participate in the network by earning fees or other rewards. `Market makers` in DeFi are also known as liquidity providers, will be explored further in our upcoming blog posts.

### Assets

Traditional finance deals with a wide range of `assets` including stocks, bonds, commodities, and currencies. These assets are traded on regulated markets and their value is determined by supply and demand.

In DeFi, the primary `assets` are cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin and Ethereum. These cryptocurrencies are traded on decentralized exchanges (DEXs) which operate without a central authority. In addition to cryptocurrencies, DeFi also deals with other blockchain-based `assets` such as non-fungible tokens (NFTs).

In summary, the main differences between traditional finance and `DeFi` lie in their institutional structures, market makers, and the types of assets they deal with. While traditional finance relies on centralized institutions and deals with a wide range of assets, DeFi is decentralized and primarily deals with cryptocurrencies and other blockchain-based assets.

## What can you do with DeFi?

`DeFi` is a revolutionary development in the financial world. It offers a wide range of financial services that are not controlled by any central authority or intermediaries, making it more accessible, transparent, and secure than traditional finance. Here are some of the things you can do with `DeFi`:

**1. Send money globally without intermediaries:** DeFi allows you to send money to anyone around the globe without intermediaries such as banks or money transfer services. This is made possible by various cryptocurrencies and decentralized applications (dApps) that run on blockchain technology.

**2. Access stable currencies:** `DeFi` offers access to stablecoins that are pegged to the value of a particular asset such as the US dollar or gold, and offer a more stable investment option.

**3. Borrow funds using cryptocurrency as collateral:** `DeFi` allows you to borrow funds using cryptocurrency as collateral. This means that you can use your cryptocurrency holdings as collateral to secure a loan without the need for traditional loan requirements.

**4. Borrow funds without collateral:** `DeFi` also offers the possibility of borrowing funds without any collateral. Peer-to-peer lending platforms connect borrowers with lenders, making it easier for individuals to borrow funds.

**5. Start a savings plan using cryptocurrency:** `DeFi` allows you to start a savings plan using cryptocurrency. You can earn interest on your cryptocurrency holdings through various DeFi savings platforms.

**6. Trade various tokens on decentralized exchanges:** `DeFi` offers `decentralized exchanges (DEXs)` that allow you to trade various tokens without the need for intermediaries. This can be done in a more secure and transparent manner than traditional centralized exchanges.

**7. Buy insurance to protect your investments:** `DeFi` offers insurance platforms that allow you to protect your investments against various risks such as smart contract failures, price volatility, and hacking attacks.
