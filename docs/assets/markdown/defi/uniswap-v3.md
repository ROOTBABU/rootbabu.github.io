# Uniswap V3

Uniswap V3 is the latest version of the popular decentralized exchange that launched on May 5, 2021, on the Ethereum mainnet. It comes packed with several new features that offer numerous benefits to users. Here are some of the main feature updates that were introduced in Uniswap V3:

More Decentralization: Uniswap V3 takes decentralization to the next level by allowing users to create and manage their own liquidity pools without the need for a centralized authority.

Concentrated Liquidity: Uniswap V3 allows liquidity providers to concentrate their liquidity within a specific price range, which means that they can better control how their assets are used and minimize their exposure to impermanent loss.

Better Security: Uniswap V3 includes several security improvements that make it less vulnerable to hacking attacks and other security risks.

New Fee Tiers: Uniswap V3 introduces customizable fee tiers, which enable liquidity providers to set their own fees and earn a greater share of the trading fees generated by the pool.

Oracle Feed Developments: Uniswap V3 incorporates several oracle feed developments that enable users to access more accurate and timely market data.

Range Orders: Uniswap V3 includes the ability to place limit orders within a specific price range, which helps users to execute trades more efficiently.

Non-Fungible Liquidity: Uniswap V3 allows liquidity providers to create non-fungible tokens (NFTs) that represent their share of a liquidity pool. This feature gives liquidity providers more flexibility in managing their liquidity and enables them to trade their liquidity shares more easily.

License: Uniswap V3 introduces a new license, the Business Source License 1.1, which balances the needs of open-source development with the needs of sustainable commercial businesses.

These features work together to achieve better capital efficiency for the platform's traders and greater risk management for liquidity providers. Overall, Uniswap V3 offers significant improvements over its predecessor and is an exciting new development in the world of decentralized exchanges.
