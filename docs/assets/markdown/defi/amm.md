# AMM

<hr>

An Automated Market Maker (AMM) is a type of decentralized exchange (DCX) mechanism used in cryptocurrency trading.

In a traditional order book-based exchange buyers and sellers place orders at specific prices and the exchange matches those orders determining a price based on supply and demand. In contrast, an AMM relies on a mathematical algorithm to automatically determine the price of an asset based on the ratio of assets in a liquidity pool.

In an AMM-based DCX, traders can add liquidity to a pool of funds by depositing both cryptocurrencies that will be traded against each other. For example, a user can deposit an equivalent amount of Ethereum and a different amount of another token into the pool, creating a new trading pair. This pool of liquidity is used to facilitate trades and the AMM algorithm determines the price based on the ratio of tokens in the pool.

When a trader wants to make a trade, they don't have to wait for someone else to take the opposite side of their trade as the AMM can execute it automatically. The trader simply needs to input the amount of one token they want to trade and the AMM calculates the number of tokens they will receive in exchange. This exchange rate is automatically adjusted based on the trading activity in the pool maintaining a balance between the two assets.

In summary, AMMs in DCXs offer a new way of trading cryptocurrencies, providing a decentralized and efficient mechanism for exchanging assets based on a mathematical algorithm.
