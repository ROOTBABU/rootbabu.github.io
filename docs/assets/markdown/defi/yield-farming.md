Liquidity Mining - Liquidity mining is a way for users to earn rewards by providing liquidity to DeFi protocols. It's become a popular way for DeFi protocols to incentivize users to provide liquidity, and it can be an effective way to earn passive income.

Yield Farming - Yield farming is a way for users to earn high returns by moving their funds between different DeFi protocols. Yield farmers are essentially seeking out the highest returns for their capital by taking advantage of various incentives and reward programs across different protocols.

Decentralized Lending and Borrowing - Decentralized lending and borrowing protocols allow users to lend and borrow cryptocurrencies without the need for a central authority. These protocols can provide more accessible and transparent lending and borrowing options, and can also enable users to earn interest on their holdings.

Governance Tokens - Governance tokens give users a voice in the decision-making processes of a DeFi protocol. Holders of these tokens can vote on proposals that affect the protocol's operations, such as changes to the protocol's code or updates to the reward structure.

Layer 2 Scaling Solutions - Layer 2 scaling solutions aim to improve the scalability of DeFi protocols by processing transactions off-chain, and then submitting a final transaction to the blockchain. There are several different types of Layer 2 scaling solutions, including rollups and sidechains, each with their own strengths and weaknesses.
