## Centralized exchanges (CEXs)

<hr>

To gain a better understanding of how `DEXs` work and why they are necessary, it's essential to first explore the mechanics of `traditional  exhange` or `CEXs`.

`CEXs` are online platforms that facilitate the buying, selling, and trading of various cryptocurrencies using fiat currencies or other cryptocurrencies. These are operated by a single company or organization and act as intermediaries between buyers and sellers. These exchanges are controlled by a central authority and store users funds on their own servers. Examples of `CEXs` include <a href="https://www.coinbase.com/" target="_blank">Coinbase</a>, <a href="https://www.binance.com/en" target="_blank">Binance</a>, and <a href="https://www.kraken.com/" target="_blank">Kraken</a>.

`CEXs` is a type of exchange where buyers and sellers interact with a centralized `order book` and the exchange acts as a middleman to match the buyers and sellers. In a `CEXs`, market makers play a crucial role in maintaining liquidity by placing orders on both the buy and sell side of the `order book`.

The `order book` is a list of all open buy and sell orders for a particular asset, displaying the price and quantity of each order. It is updated in real-time as new orders are placed, executed, or canceled. Traders can use the `order book` to see supply and demand for a particular asset, identify the best price to buy or sell, and gauge overall market sentiment. They can also use it to place orders at the best available price or analyze market trends.

`CEXs` typically charge fees for trading, deposits, and withdrawals. These fees can vary depending on the exchange and the type of transaction. Some exchanges may also require users to go through a verification process to comply with anti-money laundering (AML) and know-your-customer (KYC) regulations.

### How `CEXs` work:

When you want to buy or sell an asset, you specify the price you are willing to pay or receive and enter the order into the exchange's order book. If another trader agrees to the terms of your order, the trade is executed and settled by the exchange. The exchange will hold your funds in an account until you are ready to use them to make a trade. If a seller is found who is willing to sell at the price you have specified, the exchange will swap the assets and transfer them to your account. 

If no buyers are found, you may need to adjust your price or look for a buyer who has already placed an order. So centralized exchanges is that you have to wait for someone else to agree to your transaction terms before the trade can be executed. This can lead to delays and lock up your funds until someone is willing to take the other side of the trade.

A real-world example of a `centralized exchange (CEX)` is `Binance`. `Binance` is one of the largest and most popular cryptocurrency exchanges, allowing users to trade hundreds of different cryptocurrencies.

On `Binance`, the exchange maintains an `order book` for each cryptocurrency pair such as `Bitcoin (BTC)` and `Ethereum (ETH)`. The `order book` displays all open buy and sell orders for that pair along with their respective prices and quantities. Traders can place market orders which execute immediately at the best available price or limit orders which specify a specific price at which the trader wants to buy or sell.

`Binance` is matching engine uses the <a href="https://www.binance.com/en/orderbook/BTC_USDT" target="_blank">order book</a> to match buy and sell orders and facilitate trades between buyers and sellers. The exchange also offers other features, such as margin trading and futures contracts, which allow traders to borrow funds or enter into contracts that bet on the future price of an asset.

### Limitation of `CEXs`:

Overall, `CEXs` offer a convenient and accessible way for users to buy and sell cryptocurrencies but they also come with some risks and limitations compared to decentralized exchanges (DEXs) such as

**1. Centralization:** `CEXs` are controlled by a central authority which means they can be vulnerable to hacks, insider trading, or manipulation.

**2. Regulations:** `CEXs` are subject to government regulations which can limit their operations and sometimes result in fees or taxes for users.

**3. Privacy:** `CEXs` require users to disclose their personal information such as name, address, and identification which can be a concern for some users who prioritize anonymity.

## Decentralized exchanges (DEXs)

<hr>

`DEXs` are a type of cryptocurrency exchange that operates on a decentralized platform, allowing users to trade cryptocurrencies without the need for intermediaries such as banks or other financial institutions. `DEXs` use smart contracts and blockchain technology to automate transactions and removing the need for a central authority. They allow users to trade cryptocurrencies without the need for intermediaries, enabling them to retain control over their funds and execute trades in a peer-to-peer manner.

Examples of DEXs include `Uniswap`, `PancakeSwap`, and `Sushiswap`.

Let's say you want to trade some of your Bitcoin for some Ethereum. You could use a centralized exchange like Coinbase which is operated by a central authority and requires you to trust Coinbase to hold and manage your funds during the trade.

Alternatively, you could use a `DEX` like `Uniswap`. `Uniswap` is a decentralized exchange that operates on the Ethereum blockchain, meaning there is no central authority controlling the exchange. Instead, `Uniswap` uses smart contracts to facilitate trades between different cryptocurrency pairs.

To use `Uniswap`, you would connect your cryptocurrency wallet (such as `MetaMask`) to the exchange and choose the cryptocurrency pair you want to trade (in this case, Bitcoin and Ethereum). Because `Uniswap` operates in a decentralized manner, there is no need for intermediaries or central authorities to manage the exchange. This means that trades can be executed more quickly and with lower fees than on centralized exchanges. Additionally, because `Uniswap` operates on the blockchain, all trades are transparent and can be audited by anyone on the network.

Overall, `DEXs` like `Uniswap` offer a more decentralized and transparent way to trade cryptocurrencies, without the need for intermediaries or central authorities to manage the exchange.

### How DEXs work:

`Centralized exchanges or CEXs` operate using the `order book method` which involves matching buy and sell orders from buyers and seller which has been effective for traditional finance and centralized exchanges, it has some drawbacks when it comes to `decentralized finance` and `DEXs`. 


`Decentralized exchanges (DEXs)` have introduced new methods to address these challenges such as `automated market makers (AMMs)` and `liquidity pools`. `AMMs` use a mathematical formula to determine the price of an asset based on the ratio of the asset in a `liquidity pool`. Liquidity pools are pools of assets that traders can use to facilitate trades without the need for a centralized order book.

We will checkout these tings in detail in next sections.

### Benefits of DEXs:

**1. No KYC:** `DEXs` do not require users to complete a Know Your Customer (`KYC`) process, which typically involves providing personal information such as name, address, and government-issued ID. This eliminates the need for users to surrender their personal information to a third-party, providing greater privacy and security.

**2. No centralized authority:** `DEXs` are not controlled by a central authority, such as a company or government. Instead, they operate on a decentralized network and are governed by open-source smart contract code. This provides greater transparency and trust for users, as the code can be audited by anyone.

**3. Faster transactions:** `DEXs` can offer faster transaction speeds compared to `CEXs`, as they do not require a centralized authority to process transactions. This can result in quicker execution times for trades and a better user experience overall.

**4. Small fees:** `DEXs` often have lower fees compared to `CEXs`, as there are no intermediaries involved in the exchange. This can result in significant cost savings for traders, especially for those who engage in high-volume trading.

**5. Global access:** `DEXs` offer global access to anyone with an internet connection, providing greater opportunities for people who do not have access to traditional financial services.

**6. Programmability:** `DEXs` offer greater programmability compared to `CEXs`, as they allow developers to build decentralized applications (dApps) on top of the exchange. This can lead to greater innovation and new use cases for the technology.

Overall, `DEXs` offer a range of benefits compared to centralized exchanges, including greater privacy, transparency, faster transactions, lower fees, global access, and programmability. As the cryptocurrency ecosystem continues to evolve, it is expected that `DEXs` will become increasingly popular and widely adopted.

### Downsides of using DEXs:

**1. No support:** `DEXs` do not offer the same level of support as centralized exchanges. If a user falls victim to a scam or mistakenly trades for a fraudulent token, there is no central authority to turn to for help or recourse. This can lead to loss of funds if users are not careful.

**2. Use of hot storage devices:** `DEXs` require the use of hot wallets which are digital wallets that are connected to the internet. This can increase the risk of hacking or theft, as hackers may target hot wallets to gain access to funds.

**3. Low liquidity:** `DEXs` often have lower liquidity compared to centralized exchanges, as there may be fewer traders and trading pairs available. This can make it more difficult for users to execute trades at their desired price.

**4. Code is open for anyone to exploit:** While the open-source nature of DEXs provides greater transparency and trust, it also means that anyone can inspect the code and potentially exploit any vulnerabilities they discover. This can lead to security risks and loss of funds for users.
