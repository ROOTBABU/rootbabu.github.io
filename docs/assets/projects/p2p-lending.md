Here is a basic outline of what a simple peer-to-peer lending platform contract might look like:

    Define the terms of the loan, including the borrower, lender, loan amount, interest rate, and loan duration.
    Allow the borrower to request a loan by calling a function and specifying the desired loan amount and loan duration.
    Allow the lender to fund the loan by calling a function and specifying the loan amount they wish to fund.
    Deduct the funded loan amount from the lender's balance and add it to the borrower's balance.
    Implement a function to calculate and pay the interest on the loan. This function can be called by either the borrower or the lender and should add the calculated interest amount to the borrower's balance and subtract it from the lender's balance.
    Implement a function to allow the borrower to repay the loan. This function should deduct the repayment amount from the borrower's balance and add it to the lender's balance.
    Implement a function to allow the lender to withdraw their funds at any time. This function should transfer the specified amount from the contract's balance to the lender's balance.

This is just a basic outline, and you may want to add additional functionality such as a credit check for borrowers or a system for rating lenders. You may also want to consider implementing safeguards to protect against fraud or misbehavior.
